//  latex.ts
//  md.vscode — the `.tex` writer.
//
//  A port of `md/md/LaTeXExport.swift` (1350 lines), and the one export where
//  byte parity with the three apps is both **required and achievable**: it
//  needs no browser, no theme and no rasterizer, so the same block model in
//  four languages must produce the same file.
//
//  Every other output md produces turns a formula into a picture (PDF, EPUB,
//  print) or into KaTeX markup (HTML). This one hands the mathematics back as
//  the `$…$` the author wrote, ready to drop into a paper and keep editing.
//  That is the whole point of the format, and it is why a math span — alone
//  among everything here — is copied through untouched while every other scrap
//  of author text is escaped.
//
//  Where LaTeX cannot do what the preview does, it says so instead of dropping:
//  a diagram fence keeps its source in a `verbatim` block under a comment
//  naming the language, and a footnote definition nothing references is still
//  printed at the end.
//
//  THE SCALAR-EXACTNESS HOUSE RULE, AND WHY IT IS FREE HERE
//  -------------------------------------------------------
//  The Swift carries a hard directive at the top: nothing in that file may call
//  `contains`, `hasPrefix`, `split` or `replacingOccurrences` on a `String`,
//  because Swift compares *grapheme clusters* and a delimiter carrying a
//  combining mark is not equal to the bare delimiter. The cost of getting it
//  wrong is listed there: a token never restored, a `%` path never refused, a
//  code block's own `\end{verbatim}` never split out.
//
//  JavaScript strings are UTF-16 code units — precisely Kotlin's model, which
//  is the one the rule is chasing — so `includes` / `startsWith` / `split` /
//  `replaceAll` are already exact and are used freely below. The one place care
//  is still needed is **per-character iteration**: `for (const ch of s)` walks
//  code points, matching Swift's `unicodeScalars`, while `s[i]` walks UTF-16
//  units and would split a surrogate pair. Every scanner here — `escape`,
//  `escapeURL`, `percentDecoded`, `containsCyrillic`, `holdsAlignmentTab`,
//  `setsSomething`, `uriScheme`, `withoutSentinels` — iterates code points.

   * A `longtable` and not a `tabular` inside a `table` float, and the difference
   * is whether the author's rows are in the PDF. A float cannot break across a
   * page, so a table taller than one does not overflow onto the next — it is
   * **truncated**. The compile is exit 0, the PDF simply stops at the row that
   * filled the page, and the only trace is one "Float too large for page" line
   * in a log nobody reads. A sixty-row table loses its last five rows and says
   * nothing. `longtable` breaks across pages, so every row the author wrote is
   * printed.
   *
   * Not being a float pays a second time. LaTeX typesets no footnote text from
   * inside a float: with a plain `\footnote` in a cell the mark prints, the
   * counter steps, and the note's words are not on the page. Inside a
   * `longtable` an ordinary `\footnote` works, so every *body* cell keeps the
   * note it cites where the author put the reference.
   *
   * The header repeats at the top of each page (`\endhead`) — a reader who
   * turns to the second page of a table needs to know what its columns are.
   *
   * The width is the widest row in the table, not the header's: a row with a
   * cell too many would otherwise overrun the alignment and take the rest of
   * the document down with it, and truncating it would throw the cell away.
   *
   * The head is the one place inside a `longtable` where a plain `\footnote`
   * still loses its words, and `\endhead` is why: the header row is typeset
   * **once** into a box that is reinserted at every page break, and LaTeX
   * discards a footnote insertion made inside a box. The compile is exit 0 and
   * the note's text is on no page. So a note first cited from the head is split
   * — see `footnoteReference` — and the `\footnotetext` it owes is written
   * after `\end{longtable}`, where it is read exactly once.
